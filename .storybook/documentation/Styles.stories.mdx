# Styles Introduction

We use tailwind in this project, the decission was made by the FE team that tailwind
suited both razor and react components and allowed for a flexible approach. We can
also define styles in scss files, as described further down. Also We work with a set
number of page templates and then its just components we are developing from the designs.

## Setup

We use webpack to bundle up the styles so that it works in storybook and also in the integrated environemnt.
If you need to add something to the config. Use the main **webpack.config.js** not just the storybook one.

## Tailwind Config

The tailwind config has been extended and modified to suit this projects specific needs.
The initial setup was based of the [style guide](https://www.figma.com/proto/Nsdf8VyJ5TtQ7qRGbkMsKL/%E2%AD%90-Nikon-Design-System?page-id=2%3A14&node-id=41%3A10278&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.07&scaling=scale-down-width&starting-point-node-id=41%3A10278).

As components in the [Design Sprints](<https://www.figma.com/file/zVt5JTVJOeP3Grimu8pkTW/%E2%AD%90-Nikon-Design-Sprints-(Roboto)?node-id=1333%3A409536>) sometimes deviate from this styleguide we are using the closet value
the defaulot tailwind config uses, so for example:

```css
/* If we need 17px padding-left */
pl-4
/* or for both directions horizontally  */
px-4
```

**IMPORTANT** Always try and use the closest value the default tailwind config has and if unsure
always round down.

A good resource is the [tailwind website](https://tailwindcss.com/).

In The config we have set screen sizes:

```js
{
	screens: {
		sm: '376px',
		md: '768px',
		lg: '1024px',
		xl: '1440px',
		'2xl': '1920px',
	},
}
```

```javascript I'm A tab
console.log('Code Tab A');
```

An important note is that we dont have tablet designs. So from a FE perspective we are making
it look good, but if unsure on a design related question please speak to Ali in design or Simon.

the best way to get familiar is to look at this config file for custom project specific settings:

- **/src/Nikon.Opti.Web/client/tailwind.config.js**

## Breakpoints for this project

Break points run from:

- mobile < 375px
- tablet 375px - 1440px
- Desktop 1440px - 1920px
- Large Desktop > 1920px

For styling using breakpoints in tailwind we use:

- sm/md/lg/xl/2xl

```css
pl-2 md:pl-4
```

(applys pl-2 below 768 and pl-4 above 768, you can use all the breakpoints to vary styles
at different sizes)

As we dont have designs for tablet (apart from header + footer) it is upto the FE dev to ensure the
page templates or components look good at all breakpoints and are fluid. If in Doubt ask a member of the
design team or a fellow frontender.

## Z-Index for this project

Z-Index is important for this project, especially Nav Components and their respective drop-down functionality.
We have extented the Tailwind Config to include 10 levels of Z-Index classes z-0 to z-100 in increments of 10. We also have z-max, bu this should be reserved for only custom cursors or the site notification.

Z-Index classes may be implemented in both Component files (.jsx or .cshtml for the limited number of Razor Components), and on Razor page templates (.cshtml). If you're getting unexpected results then make sure you have checked both Components and Page Templates.

Components / Elements follow this heirachy (current as of 26th May 2022 - Tim Iland)

- z-max : Modals, Info Tray
- z-100 : Site Notification, Drag Cursor
- z-90 : Mobile Sub Nav , Search Overlay
- z-80 : Header, Sub Nav
- z-70 : Anchor Nav / Product Nav
- z-0 - z-50 : Non-Nav elements, e.g. Glow, Product Images, Background Images
